Bedroom (on Bed)
The Living Room is east.

You can see Dresser (closed), Clock and Calendar here.

You arrived at your new house a couple of hours ago but instantly crashed on your new bed. You just woke up from your nap and realized it&apos;s already 5:00 pm. Your girlfriend Elle was going to come over to see the new place. You&apos;d better start actually looking around now. It&apos;s a little run down but hey, what did you expect from craigslist. Too bad you can&apos;t afford a nicer place yet.

Elle suddenly freezes. Her shocked expression locked on something behind you. You turn and suddenly see- Elle! in the kitchen glaring at both of you. Her stare is piercing, her teeth gritted, her stance wide. Your eyes only shift from her haunting expression to notice the large kitchen knife she&apos;s holding in her hand.

&quot;It&apos;s- Me?!&quot; the Elle next to you shrieks. She turns and looks at you, &quot;I can see why you were probably so confused earlier,&quot; she says. 

&quot;I don&apos;t know where you came from!&quot; screamed the other Elle, &quot;but He&apos;s staying here!&quot; She suddenly begins slowly walking toward you, knife in hand.

You open the front door and see Elle standing there. 

&quot;Hey you, got your mail. There&apos;s an party invitation from Sarah.&quot; she says, smiling before walking in and looking around. &quot;Not the nicest place in the world,&quot; she remarks, &quot;but I&apos;m glad you finally found one-Ah!&quot;

 She suddenly trips on a rug and drops the mail in her hand. Huh, didn&apos;t even notice that there on the floor. You rush over and help her up. &quot;Sorry about that,&quot; she laughs. &quot;We should probably do something about the rug though. If not, knowing me, this&apos;ll definately happen again.&quot;

Elle suddenly freezes. Her shocked expression locked on something behind you. You turn and suddenly see- Elle! in the kitchen glaring at both of you. Her stare is piercing, her teeth gritted, her stance wide. Your eyes only shift from her haunting expression to notice the large kitchen knife she&apos;s holding in her hand.

&quot;It&apos;s- Me?!&quot; the Elle next to you shrieks. She turns and looks at you, &quot;I can see why you were probably so confused earlier,&quot; she says. 

&quot;I don&apos;t know where you came from!&quot; screamed the other Elle, &quot;but He&apos;s staying here!&quot; She suddenly begins slowly walking toward you, knife in hand.

&quot;The mirror!&quot; exclaims Elle. &quot;Things started getting weird after we went down into the basement. It sounds crazy but that must be it!&quot; 
Elle suddenly freezes. Her shocked expression locked on something behind you. You turn and suddenly see- Elle! in the kitchen glaring at both of you. Her stare is piercing, her teeth gritted, her stance wide. Your eyes only shift from her haunting expression to notice the large kitchen knife she&apos;s holding in her hand.

&quot;It&apos;s- Me?!&quot; the Elle next to you shrieks. She turns and looks at you, &quot;I can see why you were probably so confused earlier,&quot; she says. 

&quot;I don&apos;t know where you came from!&quot; screamed the other Elle, &quot;but He&apos;s staying here!&quot; She suddenly begins slowly walking toward you, knife in hand. 

&quot;We&apos;ve got to get out of here!&quot; pleads Elle, grabbing your arm. &quot;C&apos;mon!&quot;

&quot;The mirror!&quot; exclaims Elle. &quot;Things started getting weird after we went down into the basement. It sounds crazy but that must be it!&quot; 
Elle suddenly freezes. Her shocked expression locked on something behind you. You turn and suddenly see- Elle! in the kitchen glaring at both of you. Her stare is piercing, her teeth gritted, her stance wide. Your eyes only shift from her haunting expression to notice the large kitchen knife she&apos;s holding in her hand.

&quot;It&apos;s- Me?!&quot; the Elle next to you shrieks. She turns and looks at you, &quot;I can see why you were probably so confused earlier,&quot; she says. 

&quot;I don&apos;t know where you came from!&quot; screamed the other Elle, &quot;but He&apos;s staying here!&quot; She suddenly begins slowly walking toward you, knife in hand. 

&quot;We&apos;ve got to get out of here!&quot; pleads Elle, grabbing your arm. &quot;C&apos;mon!&quot;

Basement
A small and poorly lit space beneath the living room.

You can see Elle, Elle, Hidden Door and Mirror here.
